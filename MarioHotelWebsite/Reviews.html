          Shimla was my favorite summer holiday destination in India. I visit there with my friends before one month. We are five friends there, I, Richard, Max, David and Ronald. Before arrival to the beautiful Shimla land we had reserved our hotel through Maxxfun Holidays, a tour operator company. Thanks to this tour operator agent to arrange such a luxurious hotel in reasonable priced. It was our wonderful summer journey of friends. We had stayed one week at Hotel Asia The Dawn Shimla, it was one of the best five-star hotels in Shimla. All hotel staffs were helpful mind. The hotel food menu was too testy, very difficult to us forget his menus. The traditional Indian food menu was amazing. The hotel had arranged a tour operator who engaged to guide us.

          There were many dazzling and wonderful attractive spots to watch like Jakhu Hill, Lord Hanuman temple and local handicraft museum. Jakhu Hill is a mind-blowing hill station and according to the tour operator the hill station is safety trekking place among India. In next day morning we had gone trekking trip, really the trip was unforgettable. It was difficult to expression that moment. Apart from trekking we had also enjoyed shopping.
          
          At early morning of seventh day we had visited Tara Devi, according to local believe the Shimla tour remain incomplete if a tourist never visit Goddess Tara Devi temple. The temple distance was only 11km from our hotel. The temple had many traditional memories, at the first visiting the temple we were totally confused but our travel guider had clearly convinced us. Really our Shimla trip was amazing but all we had given all credit to Maxxfun Holidays tour Operator Company who helps to make our summer vacation memorable
